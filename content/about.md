I'm based in Brighton, Lead Architect at [Matchbox Mobile][1], specialising in mobile, voice and cloud systems.

Previously a senior developer, consultant and business owner I've been in the industry for 15 years. Among other languages my focus has been on HTML5/JS, native iOS, C# and Bluetooth LE.

I provide training and have written and delivered courses on advanced JavaScript, Restful API's, ASP.NET, LINQ and SQL Server.

I've spoken at various events including giving the keynote at the US Federal Reserve Bank’s annual web conference 2012, and have spoken on subjects such as Cordova at smaller local events such as Async Brighton. Contact me if you would like me to speak at your event.
