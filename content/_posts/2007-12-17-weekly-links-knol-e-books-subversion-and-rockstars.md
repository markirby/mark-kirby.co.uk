In absence of the del.icio.us plugin I used to use to present the links (its unchangable default of daily posting was a bit much) here are my links for this week.

**SEO**

The SEO world has been filled with talk of googles wikipedia beater [Knol][1] this week, not sure about it myself, I don&#8217;t think we need an app like this.

[Randfish][2] alerted subscribers to an excellent tool for viewing websites the way the spiders do &#8211; [seo-browser][3].

**Design**

Sitepoint have a detailed article on [typography][4], Web Designer Wall present a small and focused article on [emphasizing certain text using contrast and flow][5].

Web designer wall present some inspiration in their [Best of CSS 2007][6] article.

[Save the pixel][7] is a new e-book from webdesign from scratch. Its £15 and is aimed at people wanting &#8216;to create simple, easy-to-use, and appealing web sites that really work. The link also links to several older e-books, that just cost a pound or so.

** Coding**

Vitamin explain how to [create sexy stylesheets][8] &#8211; some great advanced stuff on creating the best CSS code, and laying it out in a way thats easy to update.

Its been covered before but Sitepoint&#8217;s [PHP Pagination][9] article presents an alternative viewpoint.

[Beanstalk][10] is a hosted subversion environment &#8216;making it easy for anyone to **setup, browse, track, and manage** Subversion repositories&#8217; &#8211; its free and allows for limited space with 2 users. Ideal if your working on on app with a friend.

[Ext JS 2.0][11] is yet another Javascript library, it looks very complete and professional though, so worth a little look.

**Other**

[How to be a rockstar freelancer][12] is an ebook on becoming a freelancer from freelancing blog freelanceswitch. Looks pretty comprehensive and well designed. Its £29.00 though, a little steep perhaps. I&#8217;m more interested in How to be a rockstar wordpress, which should be released soon. You can sign up to a release date mail list with discount voucher for that book on the same link.
