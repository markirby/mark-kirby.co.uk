I attended a wine tasting event tonight&#8230;the geek wine thing. its a wine tasting event aimed at the Brighton tech community, run by [Danny Hope][1] on an occasional basis. The format is, a speaker comes who has specific knowledge of wine, or cider, or some other drink, and there is a tasting along with some education about the drinks being sampled.

Tonights expert was regular host Henry Butler of [Butlers Wine Cellar in Brighton][2]. The focus was on wines from Europe, and the choices were a little different to the usual French and Spanish instead focusing mainly on Eastern Europe and Italy. Henry was an excellent host, providing first an introduction to wine tasting in general and following with some information about each wine along with the essential tasting.

Of the wines tonight, 4 stood out and actually prompted me to take advantage of the 10% discount and make a few purchases. I've listed each, along with the price from The Butlers Wine Cellar.

Le Salette Valpolicella Classico 2006 (Italy) - an excellent red, light and easy to enjoy mid week with a meal. One to share with friends and get drunk on - £8.95

Alpha Zeta Amarone 2003 (Italy) - this was a really rich and gorgeous red, the sort of wine to enjoy with cheese, and perhaps have just the one glass. Its not the kind I get to try too often, generally purchasing in the lower ranges of supermarkets selections - £20.00

Oremus Tokaji Late Harvest 2004 (Hungary) - a sweet wine, but not too overpowering. One I could drink a lot more of than the average 'desert wine&#8221; - £10.50 per half litre

Biddended Gribble ridge Rose 2006 (England) - this one tasted a little like cranberry and apple juice, but thats no bad thing. A light refreshing wine, perfect for summer - £7.95

So in summary, a fascinating and eye opening evening. No more cheap wines for me! (well, not so many anyway)

You can visit [Butlers Wine Cellar][2] at 247 Queen's Park Road, Brighton, open 11 - 7 Tue - Sat. They also run regular wine tastings on Friday nights.

Oh yes - and Andy and Henry from Butlers Wine Cellar will be cycling through some of the wine regions of France to raise money for The Chestnut Treehouse Children's Hospice, which is nice. More info at [www.MadDogsAndEnglishWine.com][4]
