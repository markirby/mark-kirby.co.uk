I&#8217;m doing some research on SEO, I&#8217;ll leave my findings here. First up &#8211; tools.  
There are a number of tools which can aid in Search Engine Optimisation. Here’s a summary of each, where to find them and what they are useful for.

**<a title="WordTracker Keyword Tool" href="http://www.wordtracker.com/" target="_blank">WordTracker</a>**  
This tool allows you to see how popular keyword search terms are as made by meta search engines such as dogpile.com. It has a number of advanced features for finding all the keywords which could be related to your site, and which are most popular. It gives precise numbers of searches on meta engines, and estimated numbers overall. It suggests good alternative keywords. This tool can then be used to identify which search terms to optimise for.

You have to pay to use this service, roughly £5 a day or £14 for a week. You can sign up for just the day if you want.

**[Google Adwords Keyword Tool][1]**  
This is similar to wordtracker, but it only uses data from people who searched on google and provides you with less detailed information. This can help you identify what search terms to optimise for.

It also shows you usefully what keywords it finds your site already holds. This can be useful for checking these are the keywords you wanted to be found with and that they match the popular ones.

**[Yahoo Keyword Selector Tool][2]**  
This works like google but provides information based on yahoo searches. It seems slower too. Could be used along with google and word tracker.

**[SEOQUAKE][3]**  
This add-on for firefox is excellent for SEO use. For each page you visit it can provide you with page rank, the number of pages google and other search engines index on the site, the number of links found to the site and page, links in digg, technorati and delicious and – most useful of all – a keyword density check for the page.

This information can be used to:

  * Identify how popular you are in search engines to identify weaknesses
  * Find out who is linking to you and how, to see what effect the terms they use in the links may be having on your ranking
  * See how many people link to you to identify where improvements need to be made
  * To quickly see what keywords you are using in each page to improve them if necessary
  * To see what keywords your rivals use in their pages to add them to yours or to see who has the most density and whether density improvements are worthwhile

The information can be viewed on any page you are looking at or at search engine results. Its worth setting up the preferences properly to see what you want to see.
