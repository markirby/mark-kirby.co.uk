I&#8217;ve been invited to write a column on a new site called [Freelance Advisor][1], which is run by Darren Fell of [pure360][2], who is currently working on a new venture, crunch.co.uk. This site is aimed at helping people based in the UK (although lots of advice can be used anywhere) to get started as a Freelancer. Its content is growing fast, and its well worth subscribing. Its not technical specific either, so can be used by anyone.

My column will focus on lifehacks, and time management techniques which I use to get things done quicker and more effectively. I&#8217;m always learning new ones, and adapting them if needed. There&#8217;s plenty on this out there, but I&#8217;m going to present exactly what works for me, rather than a huge unmanageable bunch of ideas and concepts. Hopefully it will help some people out. [The first post][3] introduces [GTD][4], [4 hour workweek][5] and [remember the milk][6].
