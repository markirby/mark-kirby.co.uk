Using the [Seoquake firefox plug-in][1] do the following:

### Page caches

  1. Make sure the preferences are setup so the Google cache date displays on Google search results.
  2. Do an advanced search in Google, with 100 results shown for the search term site:www.yourwebsiteaddress.com  
    Click on the down arrow at the top of the page next to the ‘cached’ option.
  3. You can now see, in order which pages have been cached most recently, and therefore how recently the page was accessed by Google and cached. It may be that the page was accessed and not cached, but this method is a quick way of getting a rough idea.
  4. Or: type site:yourwebsiteaddress.com into google and look at each cached page.

### Page ranks

Use the same technique as the cache but order by page rank option to see which pages have the highest page rank and identify problem pages with low page ranks.

### Number of pages indexed

  1. Go to a page on your website.
  2. The included information will show you, if you tell SEOBar in preferences to include it, the number of pages each search engine has indexed for your site.
  3. Click on the number to see the pages listed.

Or: type site:yourwebsiteaddress.com into google or yahoo and look at the number of results.

### What to do with this information

Are search engines listing all the pages on your site, if not you need to get them to notice them. Are the pages ranked highly, if not you need to try to improve their rankings. Is google revisiting and caching your pages? If not, consider sitemaps or more regular updates.
