I purchased an iPhone from O2 today. I was surprised to find that when signing up they didn&#8217;t require me to take out a contact, I simply purchased the phone and was told to plug it in to my computer to get it working.

Here&#8217;s what you need to do to set up the iPhone.

## Get a PAC code

If you aren&#8217;t with O2 and want to keep your number, like me, you will need to get the PAC code from your current mobile provider. I had to call Vodafone to get mine and it came in the post 5 days later. Sometimes they text it to you.

## Get an iTunes Account

Get an [iTunes account][1] &#8211; you must download the software if you don&#8217;t already have it, and register your debit card and address for an account.

## Get the following to hand

  * Your apple id and password to hand if you have one
  * Your bank account number and sort code
  * An iPhone
  * Your home phone number
  * Your address

## Set up your O2 account

Plug the phone into your computer and start up iTunes.

iTunes will look like this:

Click continue, and O2 check your account details.

If your not an O2 customer you need to create a new account. I had to select this option.

Next you are offered the chance to transfer your current phone number. I want to do that, and I&#8217;ve got my PAC code from earlier. If you do too, enter your mobile number in the boxes, and your PAC code, and check the transfer existing mobile number box.

Don&#8217;t make a mistake! Then press continue.

Now O2 will check the details, and if they are OK you get to choose your tariff.

Pick the one you want, I&#8217;m going for Â£35 per month.

Now you need to enter your apple id if you have one. Otherwise you will need to pick one.

If you have an id already, some details will be filled in for you on the next form which asks for your name and gets you to add a username and password.

If your name is available you are asked for your house number, post code and home phone as well as bank details for the direct debit and an email.

Finally you will need to accept the agreement.

Review all the data and submit.

You will now be told your iPhone is being activated. It can take 5 days for your old number to be ported across and a few hours for activation to complete.

Now the iPhone tells me I have no signal. Hmm.

## Set up your iPhone

I&#8217;m using a Mac so this part may differ on a PC. I&#8217;m asked if I want to sync contacts to my iPhone. It would be best to get the contacts from your current phone into address book first in order to make life easier.

Luckily I have already done this using [Soocial][8][![set-up-your-iphone-screen.png][9]][10].

You need to pick a name for the iPhone and decide if you want to sync automatically.

All my contacts go across and the sync is complete.

You can now remove the iPhone and use it!

It may take a while for the No Service message to dissappear, especially if your transfering from another network, I was on O2 by the morning, but it takes around 5 days for your number to come across. You get a temporary number in the meantime.
