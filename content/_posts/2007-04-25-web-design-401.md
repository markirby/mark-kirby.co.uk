A friend told me last night he&#8217;s planning on building a website and could do with a few resources. I thought I&#8217;d suggest a few here so he, or anyone else, can get a head start of web design.

First I recommend buying [Web Design In a Nutshell][1] by O-Reill. It will cost you around Â£16 and is a great resource covering all you might need to know to get started.

Then check out the [Web Developers Handbook][2], a massive list of online resources about CSS, design, tools to help you, Search Engine Optimisation etc. If you find theres too many resources there to get your head around, I have my own lists of resources on:

  * [Design][3]
  * [Accesibility][4]
  * [CSS][5]
  * [SEO][6]

These resources have done me well, I&#8217;ve used them all this year. Finally, for more lists of great resources, updated weekly try going to [Smashing Magazine][7].

Hope that helps Jason, and anyone else!
