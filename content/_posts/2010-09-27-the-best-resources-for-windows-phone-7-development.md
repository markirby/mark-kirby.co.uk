Here is a collection of great resources to get you started developing for Windows Phone 7, and to continue doing so. I&#8217;ll be keeping this post up-to-date over the coming months.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-725" title="Windows Phone 7" src="http://mark-kirby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4363791895_ab689c135a.jpg" alt="Windows Phone 7" width="500" height="329" />

## Official documentation

  * [Windows Phone for Developers][1] – a hub for all info from Microsoft, although it feels somewhat sparse at first glance
  * [MSDN official documentation for Windows Phone 7][2] – covers all API’s and classes provided by Windows Phone 7, as well as highlighting differences between platforms
  * MSDN [Visual C# Developer Center][3]{#ctl00_Masthead_brandlink}
  * [Windows Team Blog][4] – occasionally updated with the latest release news and tips

## Getting started learning Windows Phone 7

Here is a video introduction to the platform, covering a simple hello world app to get you started:



Then check out:

  * [Start here on the Windows Phone Team blog][5] &#8211; this introduces the main training kits and links to downloads of the latest release of developer tools
  * [Windows Phone 7 with Mike Harsh][6] &#8211; A recent discussion on the platform with hints and tips (Aug 2010)
  * Building [Windows Phone 7 Applications with Silverlight Part One][7], and [Part Two][8] &#8211; 2 part presentation from MIX10 introducting the tools and skills needed to get started with Silverlight for Windows Phone 7 (from Spring 2010 so slightly out of date)

Learning C#:

  * [C# Yellow Book][9] &#8211; before learning Windows Phone 7 you need to get to know C-sharp, this free e-book is a great place to start
  * [C# cheat sheets][10] &#8211; once you&#8217;ve learnt C-sharp, these handy cheat sheets will serve as a useful reference. My favourites are [this in-depth one from corecsharp][11], [ a comparison of C-sharp and the same features in other languages][12] and one [for the basics with lovely code coloring][13]. The site also covers [XAML][14], [LINQ][15], [.NET][16] and [Silverlight][17] along with [anything else you can think of][18]

Using Visual Studio efficiently:

  * [How to refactor code using Visual Studio part 1][19], [and part 2][20] &#8211; videos on how to use VS to automatically refactor code
  * [Application Development in Visual Studio][21] and [Visual Studio Walkthroughs][22] &#8211; hints and tips on how to get the most out of Visual Studio and save yourself time and effort

Learning Windows Phone 7:

  * [The free e-book Programming Windows Phone 7][23] &#8211; this appears to be a Microsoft sponsored book which is currently in development. You can download new chapters as they become available (11 are present in the latest release) and the e-book will remain free to download on completion.
  * [WP7 Training Kit][24] – includes selected videos and hands on tutorials to provide a complete Windows Phone 7 training course
  * The aforementioned [XAML][14], [LINQ][15], [.NET][16] and [Silverlight][17] cheatsheets
  * [ScottGu&#8217;s Twitter Client training excercise][25]
  * [Windows Phone 7 for iPhone developers][26] &#8211; Jesse Liberty has a course of tutorials aimed at iPhone developers over on his blog
  * [Windows Phone 7 tutorials by Compiled Experience][27] &#8211; an on-going series of tutorials focused around a range of sample apps. Topics covered include use of the device API&#8217;s, MVVM pattern, best practices, isolated storage and more. Well laid out and easy to follow.

Tips for designers:

  * [Designing a flexible user interface][28]
  * [Windows Phone 7 Design resources &#8211; UI Guide and design templates][29]

How to figure out what class libraries are available on Windows Phone 7, doing so is sadly nightmarish and highly confusing:

  1. Look at the [full list of Silverlight classes][30]
  2. Remove [those listed as unsupported][31]
  3. Show your bosses [this list, which provides a summary in english of what is/isn&#8217;t supported][32]
  4. Here are [some classes which are supported (but not all classes)][33]
  5. [Supported Silverlight features which behave differently in Windows Phone 7][34]
  6. [Windows Phone 7 specific classes][35]
  7. [All Silverlight classes, some of which won&#8217;t be available][30] (see above)

Video sessions introducing topics and providing tutorials (in order of release, newest first so most relevant):

  * [Inside Windows Phone Series][36] &#8211; ongoing series of videos on Windows Phone from Channel 9, &#8216;Watch  exclusive interviews with the designers, product managers and developers coding the Windows Phone OS and developer platform&#8217;
  * [Windows Phone 7 Jump Start training videos][37] &#8211; 12 hour course in Windows Phone 7 Development
  * [Windows Phone Design Day recordings][38] &#8211; Series of sessions from Microsoft presented in August 2010, focus on designers
  * [Silverlight Screencasts Windows Phone 7][39] section which currently has 4 screencasts covering the basics
  * [Microsoft TechEd Online Windows Phone 7][40] &#8211; all the Windows Phone 7 sessions from the TechEd conference which took place in June 2010
  * [MIX10, March 2010][41] &#8211; watch all the sessions online from MIX10 in March 2010, with around 10 on Windows Phone 7
  * [General Videos on Windows Phone 7 ][42]- an unorganised but comprehensive collection of training videos
  * [YouTube videos on Windows Phone 7 and Silverlight][43]

## Events

  * [PDC10, Oct 2010][44] &#8211; Microsoft PDC conference in Redmond, WA. All sessions to be streamed online, promises plenty of Windows Phone 7 sessions in the second track. Also a good opportunity to meet US developers. $1000.
  * [Windows Phone 7 User Group in London][45] & [Silverlight UK User Group][46] &#8211; events to be announced on a semi-regular basis
  * [Windows Phone 7 Developer day][47], free event in Manchester (UK), 7th Oct 2010
