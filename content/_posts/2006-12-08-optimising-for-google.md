Some hints i picked up on optimization listening to a <a title="Listen to the original podcast" href="http://www.boagworld.com/archives/2006/09/podcast_51_better_google_listings.html" target="_blank">boagworld.com podcast</a>.

  1. Pick the keywords you wish to target, make them quite specific and ones others will not select in a big way
  2. Create keyword heavy urls &#8211; urls count
  3. Make the h1 the name of the page heading, not the site heading &#8211; stick that in a div instead
  4. Make sure all pages have content on them, no pages of links on their own etc
  5. Try to include keywords in your navigation and the title tag you associate with each navigation item
  6. Include breadcrumbs wherever possible, they help users and add keywords to the page
  7. Look out for keyword density, try to ensure those keywords you identified have a reasonably high density within the page. 5% is a reasonable figure, lower won&#8217;t rank you, higher gets silly and could pose a risk
  8. Use web standards
  9. Javascript is ignored by search engines, so make sure it degrades nicely and make sure it is unobtrusive, separated into include files
 10. Google confuses domain names sometimes, &#8216;www.avert.org&#8217; &#8216;avert.org&#8217; &#8216;avert.org/index.html&#8217; are all ways people link to the same site and can cause google to imagine this is 2 sites. Use a 301 redirect to solve the problem.
 11. Metatags should be unique for each page on your site &#8211; descriptions and keywords, they do help still
 12. Cross link your pages with one another, helps google to spider your site and understand what the page is about using the url description. Be consistent in the way you link to pages, e.g always link to the about us page using the term &#8216;find out more about us&#8217;
 13. All images need alt tags associated with them
 14. Create a sitemap of your entire site
