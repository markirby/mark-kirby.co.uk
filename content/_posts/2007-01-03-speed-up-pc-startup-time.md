My Laptop is running slowly at the moment. Today I found a way to quickly speed up startup time. Go to the Start menu, Run, and type &#8220;msconfig&#8221; (no quotes.) In the Startup tab, uncheck anything you don&#8217;t need (leave on virus scan, turn off the instant messenger program you stopped using months ago.) There is also a tool for doing this &#8211; [autoruns][1].
