As a PHP developer I have long been seeking a good framework to cut down development time. 4 months ago I discovered CakePHP which takes on the work of all the CRUD database communication for you, basically meaning you dont need to write functions to add, edit or delete items from tables yourself. The website <a title="CakePHP" href="http://www.cakephp.org/" target="_blank">cakephp</a> will tell you more. I&#8217;ll add my own hints here.
