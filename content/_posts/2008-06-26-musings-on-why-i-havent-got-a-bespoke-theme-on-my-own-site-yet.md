I&#8217;ve had a number of comments recently about my blog, and the fact it uses the default Kubrick theme, when I am currently selling my WordPress theming services. I thought I&#8217;d add this post to explain my rationale.

The main reason is I&#8217;ve only been freelancing for a short time, and have found myself rather busy, so rest assured its on my todo list.

Some people have suggested I install someone else&#8217;s theme &#8211; but I think its important to go with the right theme, so that would take time to select. I also think people would expect to see a theme I had developed, so that might well be time wasted.

If you are interested in the kind of thing that can be achieved with WordPress theming, take a look at [handsonphysiotherapy.co.uk][1] &#8211; a simple site I built without a blog element, using WordPress as its back end. In the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be putting a portfolio together to show some of the other WordPress integrations I&#8217;ve been working on, and I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on how to theme WordPress to manage a simple site at [The Werks][2] on July 24th, so come along and find out more.
