Its that time of year where I like to look back and summarise what I've done, ready for the new years plans. So in 2010:

  * I lead development for [Ribot][1] on the [Tesco Grocery App for Nokia][2] which allows customers to shop from their phones, [released back in the summer][3].
  * I had 2 articles published for [.net magazine][4] - a PhoneGap tutorial and an opinion piece on Responsive Web Design (expect to hear a lot more on that subject in the new year!).
  * I gave a well subscribed [talk on PhoneGap][5] at a local JavaScript user group, asyncjs
  * We grew the development team at Ribot, and were lucky enough to snag [Jason Fry][6] - an Android developer in high demand.
  * I popped along to the fantastic [mlove festival in Germany][7], something to look out for next year
  * The rest of the time I worked on some secret projects, one of which will be released early next year

In summary a year of mobile web, including plenty of JavaScript, PhoneGap, responsive web design and testing.

Outside of work I moved into a nice little 1 bed apartment with my girlfriend, cat and 2 hamsters, watched some great films with [@ribotminimus][8], invested in some of the worlds best kitchen equipment and subsequently did lots of cooking. In an attempt to keep RSI at bay, I did very little blogging and personal projects this year, but lots ofÂ exercise. RSI stayed away, so this year I might tempt fate a little...
