In the [previous post][1] you can see slides from the talk I gave at [The Werks][2] in Hove last week. It was a full event, with around 20 attendees, so thanks to all for coming, and helping raise money for The Werks. Thanks also to [Rosie][3] for inviting me along.

During the talk we touched on one important point &#8211; its incredibly easy to make a really simple theme for WordPress. I&#8217;ve attached the [sample code][4] here for you to browse. Its a really simple theme, with just 2 files, and will output any pages you have inside your blog in a horizontal bar at the top of your site. Feel free to play around with it and use it as the basis for your theme, although I would recommend starting a theme yourself from scratch.

For those who missed the talk, I&#8217;ll be speaking again at [BarCampBrighton3][5] and [BarCampLondon5][6]. I&#8217;ll likely give the WordPress talk (shortened version) at the Brighton BarCamp, and if it goes down well, at London too.
