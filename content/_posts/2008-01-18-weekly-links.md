**SEO**

[SEO Browser][1] is a great tool which lets you see webpages as a search engine does, run all tour sites through it.

**User Interface Design**

UIE have written a couple of features on how to [avoid making mistakes when building account sign in features][2] in your apps. Lots to think about, especially for e-commerce sites.

**Design**

Two finds this week &#8211; [tablecloth][3] is a piece of javascript which styles your tables and adds visual functionality, ideal for tables of data. [CurvyCorners][4] is one of the easiest ways I&#8217;ve seen yet of making rounded corners with Javascript and no images.
