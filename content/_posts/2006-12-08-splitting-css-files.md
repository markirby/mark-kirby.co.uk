Many people recommend splitting CSS files down into smaller files for code organisation. Yahoo recently conducted some [research][1] proving that the more files downloaded by a page (css files, image files, javascript files etc) the longer a page takes to download. This means reducing the number of files loaded by a page will speed up the page loading. One or two CSS files will therefore be better than more.
