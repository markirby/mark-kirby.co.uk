This is interesting &#8211; a software letting you run IE 5, 5.5., 6 and 7 (beta) on your Mac without needing parallels. This could be great for testing.

Its called [ies4osx][1] and requires OSX tiger or leopard, and an Intel machine. On tiger you need have to installed X11.

[Download it here.][1]

I found the download process pretty simple, a few things to do, but nothing too time consuming.
