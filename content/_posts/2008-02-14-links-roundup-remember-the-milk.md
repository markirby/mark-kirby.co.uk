## Web Apps

First off, I&#8217;ve started using a fantastic little app for organising your life this week &#8211; [rememberthemilk][1] its immensely usable, and lets you list the things you have to do, organised by project if you wish. You can set due dates, and have tasks recur on a regular basis. It has plugins for iPhone, facebook and netvibes. Great for [gtd][2] fans.

Speaking of [netvibes][3], that&#8217;s another tool i&#8217;ve only just discovered. A little like OS X&#8217;s dashboard, it lets you save a webpage full of widgets which can provide you with all sorts of data in one easy location. I&#8217;ve got mine set up to report on all my email accounts, facebook &#8211; see if I&#8217;ve got any messages and what people are up to, and myspace. Its my homepage, so now I only need to check one location for all these things, and no multiple sign ins.

## Ruby

If you haven&#8217;t come across it, check out [Why&#8217;s poignant guide to ruby][4]. Its a strange little manual about the language Ruby, but its more like an art scrapbook than a programming book. Great for fans of David Shrigley who are also geeks!

## Wallpapers

Smashing Magazine have released a list of some of the [best free wallpapers on the web][5]. Unlike most, these actually are really nice, and fit large screens.

## Life changing stuff

I&#8217;ve started to read the Tim Ferriss book &#8211; 4 hour workweek. In it Tim explains how he managed to live the life he always wanted to by following a range of techniques and really thinking &#8220;outside the box&#8221; as they say. Now he only does 4 hours of uninteresting work a week and spends the rest of his time doing whatever he pleases (which is not lazing around). [Check out his blog][6], and I recommend the book too &#8211; out in UK in April.
