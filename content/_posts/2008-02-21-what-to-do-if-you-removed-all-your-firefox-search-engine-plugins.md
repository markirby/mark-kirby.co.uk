I was playing around with Firefox search engine plugins this evening and I decided to remove all of them from my browser. Once this is done, you can&#8217;t add any more, your stuck without any and can&#8217;t add any.

Luckily there is a solution. Find your firefox user profile (on a mac its located in your user folder, inside /Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/aFunnyNumber.profile and remove the file inside called search.sqlite. Now restart firefox, and all your search engines will be set to default, ready for you to start removing them again. Not them all this time!
