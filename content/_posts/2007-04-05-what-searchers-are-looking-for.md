SEO Moz released this video this week about search intent.



In summary:

  * More interesting titles and meta descriptions can encourage people to click on search results which come third or fourth instead of first. Search &#8216;oatmeal&#8217; in google to see why.
  * There are three types of search intent

  * Navigation searches &#8211; search google in yahoo to find the google page
  * Informational &#8211; find out more about a topic, location etc
  * Commercial &#8211; i want a new job, a new web designer etc.

  * The person searching is looking for the keyword he used, and other related ones, someone searching oatmeal might be pleased to see recipes, as thats what he wanted but didnt search
  * He gets to see title, meta description, url and highlighted text
  * You need to make these relevant and interesting to get people to click
