These came from the practical web design magazine [podcast 36][1].

  1. Use CSS not tables.
  2. Ensure everything you produce is cross platform compatible – browser and operating system
  3. Keep it simple, only use technology where users need it. Find the most simple solution. Don’t implement things like multimedia where they will just irritate users.
  4. Use semantic HTML. Make sure it describes what the content is, not what it looks like. No id = left column or id = right.
  5. Don’t forget usability testing. Test against real users in real situations trying to complete real tasks.
  6. Always use unobtrusive JavaScript. Separate behaviour from content. Keep JavaScript in a JavaScript include file. No onClick events attached to links etc. This ensures the site degrades nicely on older browsers and keeps the site code clean.
  7. Use progressive enhancement. Start by ensuring the application works without JavaScript, then add it to enhance the use of the site.
  8. Provide clear and consistent navigation. Clearly and consistently mark-up what is navigation and keep it always in the same place. Keep options minimal and use good naming conventions. Look for naming conventions in your sector and make yours match those where possible – e.g. call the ‘about us’ page ‘about us’ if everyone else does.
  9. Ensure return on investment is always on mind when implementing something on a website. Ask yourself if it matches the business needs of the client.
 10. Pay attention to your content. Spend less time on design and technology and ensure content is king. Update and refresh it on a regular basis.
