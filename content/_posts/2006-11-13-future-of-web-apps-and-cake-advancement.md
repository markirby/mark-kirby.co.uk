It looks like a good line-up and only cost £155 for two days, although now its £195, I got in just in time. Details found on <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/" target="_blank">http://www.futureofwebapps.com/</a>

Spent the rest of the day working with cakePHP improving skills in various areas and working through the updated manual. I learned the following skills:

Separating the cake folder out from the individual applications so one folder can be updated whenever the cake source code is updated instead of updating several. The vendor folder also needs to be moved, and the code in the webroot/index.php should point to the folder containing the cake and vendor folder. Find out how to do this here: <a href="http://manual.cakephp.org/chapter/installing" target="_blank">http://manual.cakephp.org/chapter/installing</a>

Worked out an easy way of deleting entries in a database without actually deleting them using cakePHP. Marking for deletion basically. There’s a blog entry on how this is done here:

Got Ajax working in an application so you can add to dropdown boxes from within another form. I’ll publish a solution to this later once I’ve further developed it. Its based on this tutorial: <a href="http://grahambird.co.uk/cake/tutorials/ajax.php" target="_blank">http://grahambird.co.uk/cake/tutorials/ajax.php</a>

Also found a good del.icio.us <a href="http://www.rknet.it/program/delibar/" target="_blank">toolbar</a> for looking at your bookmarks inside a Mac , and a device for <a href="http://bombich.com/software/ccc.html" target="_blank">cloning Mac drive</a> which I’ve been searching for a while.  
I tried yahoo’s myWeb recently as a bookmark sharer, but I’m going to move back to del.icio.us as it’s more widely supported with a large range of applications for it.
