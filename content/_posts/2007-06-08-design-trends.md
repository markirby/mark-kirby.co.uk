I have been reading a great guide on [current web design trends][1]. Check it out &#8211; here are some key points:

  * Simple layouts, 1 and 2 columns
  * Centered layouts, no more liquid and left aligned
  * Design content, not the background
  * Subtle gradients and drop shadows
  * Plain white background, perhaps with greyscale fades
  * Few simple 3d icons
  * White space
  * Big text
