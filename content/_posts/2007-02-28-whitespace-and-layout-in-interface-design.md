Tips on whitespace and layout from a [boagworld][1] podcast interview with [Dan Rubin][2].

  * Whitespace is breathing room in design, ensuring things are not cramped.
  * All text needs space to breathe &#8211; add space above and below text and within text lines.
  * Navigation should not be cramped. Don&#8217;t have too many items, making it easy for the user to see where to go.
  * Navigation should be well proportioned, not too small and cramped, don&#8217;t have large text in a tiny tab.
