I was reading a book today, &#8216;Web Accessibility&#8217; and it brought something to my attention. The Internet improves the lives of the disabled, allowing them to do stuff that they could not have done before AT ALL. In that respect it could be said to be an even more valuable tool for those with disabilities than it is for those without disabilities.

  * People who cannot walk can shop online
  * People who cannot see can get more information read to them than ever before
  * People who cannot speak can discuss online

People with vision impairment or who are unable to use a mouse need websites to be as accessible as possible. It should be our duty as website designers to ensure that this group of people who use the web should be able to use it properly. An able bodied visually healthy person can walk to the library and research a topic. A blind person cannot, but can use the internet now to achieve the same goals. Why should the person with all the choices be able to use the internet more easily than someone who requires the internet.

I have decided to read the remainder of this book, and various sources to compile some guidelines to change my websites. I&#8217;m its been done before, but I&#8217;ll publish my findings on here, for my own reference if nobody elses!
