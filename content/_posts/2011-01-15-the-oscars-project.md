Something a little different today. I wanted to let you know about a new blog I&#8217;ve started, The Oscars Project, where I&#8217;m watching and reviewing all the [best picture winners][2]. For a while now I&#8217;ve decided I haven&#8217;t seen enough older films from the last 100 years, and so to give my plan to see more a direction, I decided to watch ever winner of the best picture oscar since 1928 when they began.

So far I&#8217;ve seen 4 films, but I&#8217;ll be adding a new one every few days as I work my way through them. Once I&#8217;m done I plan to move on to watch all the Palme d&#8217;Or winners, Golden Lion winners and possibly even the AFI top 250 films of all time. Anyway the blog is up and running at [theoscarsproject.com][3] so check it out if you fancy some recommendations of classics.
