## Software Design

[UI Patterns][1] is a great little site which is attempting to group together often used interface techniques. If your improving or building an app its a great place for some inspiration.

## Typography

James Whittaker&#8217;s [vertical rhythm calculator][2] is an excellent tool to help you to write stylesheets that ensure the text is sized correctly and well spaced. This stuff&#8217;s easy enough to work out, but he provides a good explanation as well and links to the source [compose to a vertical rhythm article][3], also worth checking out.

This [sIFR tutorial][4] will get you implementing flash fonts in your website far quicker than the instructions that come with the tool.

## Coding

[Snipplr][5] is a new resource of code snippets, each one a function written to solve a problem like auto complete, edit in place, etc. It will take some time before this grows into something really useful, but its design is far better than most sites of its ilk and it covers PHP, RUBY, javascript, CSS, HTML and Objective C.
