## What is Alexa

Here is my take on Alexa.

* Collects voice audio and talks to the skill interface

Skill interface - provided by Amazon, you interact with and update using settings

* **Utterances** - utterances allow the interace to identify the intent (skill feature), by mapping speech to desired **intent** - 'hello', 'hi', 'how are you'
* Intent schema - define an **intent** e.g. HelloWorldIntent, also considered a skill feature, which is invoked by an **utterance**, e.g. 'hello', 'hi', 'how are you'
* **Slot types** - variables, such as date, dollar, number, which can be read from the voice
* Invokes the **skill service**

Skill service - you create

* You create the **skill service**, composed of **intent handlers** (function) to handle each intent and accept the **slot values** (variables)
* You can now:
    * Talk to other web services
    * Store or retrieve data in a database
    * Serve up content stored in JSON files
    * Respond, ask further questions and process further voice answers
* Hosted on HTTPS Server/AWS Lambda
* Responds to Alexa, at this point Alexa can communicate directly with the Skill Service for any responses

## Amazon requirements

### Invocation names

This is the name of your Skill, e.g. 'Daily Quiz'

Review [Amazon's Guidelines](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/choosing-the-invocation-name-for-an-alexa-skill) for the full list.

In summary:

* The name should make sense in multiple contexts:
    * Alexa Ask X for Y (Alexa ask {Daily Quiz} for {a question})
    * Alexa Start X (Alexa start {Daily Quiz})
    * Alexa, X (Alexa, {Daily Quiz})
* No one word invocations (unless its your brand)
* No two word invocations it one of the words is 'the', 'a', 'for' etc
* No Alexa launch phrases or connecting words (launch, ask, to, from etc)
* And more

### Required intents

Some of the built-in intents **must** be implemented, such as 'stop' and 'cancel'.
