Learn how to create a voice skill for your company or brand with this introductory post. Consider this a voice 101.

## What voice platforms should I be targeting?

There are 4 main voice platforms today:

* [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01GAGVIE4/ref=gw_aucc_dopp_AB_justask?pf_rd_r=KK0ZD4NG7F2Y9C1X15Z0&pf_rd_p=d68516ec-defa-4940-a732-0248fe232f9c), out in the UK and US, and by far the leading voice only device on the market. This is where you should begin when creating a voice skill.
* [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/), out in the US, playing catchup with Amazon, easy to get up and running and a good next place to develop your voice skill.
* [Microsoft Cortana](https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/experiences/cortana/), available in Windows 10 devices, opening for developers soon.
* [Apple Siri](http://www.apple.com/uk/ios/siri/), living inside iPhone and iPad, but with limited use cases.

## What are the key voice devices on the market?

* [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo-Black/dp/B01GAGVIE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1485615737&sr=8-1&keywords=amazon+echo&linkCode=ll1&tag=markirby-21&linkId=12714f842fbf75adfb2d69b3ca8140a5) and [Echo Dot](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Generation-Black/dp/B01DFKBL68/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1485615737&sr=8-2&keywords=amazon+echo&linkCode=ll1&tag=markirby-21&linkId=bbc57edaebb5b3b3e4dad05f6bc5e880)
