## Selected past talks

### A Mobile Primer - keynote at the US Federal Reserve Bank internal web conference 2011

April 2011 - <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas</a>, US

An introduction to the mobile web, ways of creating mobile websites, web vs native and some of the pros and cons of the options available to a company tackling mobile for the first time. Parts of this talk were aimed specifically at the FED team members, hence the US stats and many banking examples.

### PhoneGap - Write native smartphone apps with HTML5 and Javascript - Async

Session 11 of the <a href="http://asyncjs.com/phonegap/">Async JavaScript meetup</a> in Brighton, October 2010

An introduction to <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, and some of the API's. The slides are quite sparse in terms of design, this was more about getting the bare facts up there, and was an intimate (but packed) presentation with a focus on live demos.

As well as this event, I wrote a series of PhoneGap tutorials for .net magazine.
